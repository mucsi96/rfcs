# Summary

I would like to take a step forward with idea behind hooks by replacing the Context API with custom hooks.
I suggest to `useState` hook with shared state across the application.

# Basic example

I suggest having an API such as this:

```jsx
import { createSharedState } from 'react';

export const useTheme = createSharedState('light');

function App {
  return (
    <Toolbar />
    <ThemeSwitch />
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const [theme] = useTheme();

  return <Button theme={theme} />;
}

function ThemeSwitch {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useTheme();

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')}
    >
      {theme}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

For full working example please check https://codesandbox.io/s/react-create-shared-state-demo-9s9ui.

# Motivation

`createSharedState` results with a cleaner codebase with easily reusable shared state. It solves the following concerns with current Context API:  
- Developer need to think where to place the `Provider` component in the tree structure.
- There is a possibility for placing it in wrong place which will result in errors or performance issues.
- Sometimes the DOM structure need to be restructured because of it.
- Sharing context between two unrelated deeply nested components may require placing `Provider` in the root component which will result in unnecessary rerenders of the whole application.
- Often many providers are nested which makes the code hard to read.
- Testing a component which depends on context is harder due to necessary wrapping with required providers.

In React community many projects are already created with very similar idea:

# Detailed design

The design could be very easy. This is naive implementation based on public React API.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function createSharedState(defaultValue) {
  const listeners = [];

  return () => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(defaultValue);

    useEffect(() => {
      listeners.forEach(listener => listener !== setValue && listener(value));
    }, [value]);

    useEffect(() => {
      listeners.push(setValue);

      return () => {
        const index = listeners.findIndex(listener => listener === setValue);
        listeners.splice(index, 1);
      };
    }, []);

    return [value, setValue];
  };
}
```

For more details please check the [`react-create-shared-state`](https://github.com/mucsi96/react-create-shared-state) NPM package. 

# Drawbacks

As with any React hooks this works only in functional components. 

# Adoption strategy

This is not a breaking change just addition to API.
Migration from Context API to `createSharedState` can be done gradually in application.
The concept itself can be tested with [`react-create-shared-state`](https://github.com/mucsi96/react-create-shared-state) NPM package.

# How we teach this

React API documentation need to be extended with documentation for `createSharedState` function.
Also I recommend it's adoption in the tutorial and mentioning in Context API page.

# Unresolved questions

Is this function covers all use cases of Context API?
Can we easily migrate from Context API in every case? (not considering class based components)
How can we implement this with internal React API?
